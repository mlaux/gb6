This is going to be a Game Boy emulator targeting 68k Macs running System 6
or newer. Right now I'm working on the non-Mac-specific parts of the
emulator - eventually I'll integrate the UI I developed the last time I
attempted this project (which is sitting on a floppy somewhere).

Compile with [Retro68](https://github.com/autc04/Retro68)
